## Architecture

**Built on Cloudflare Workers** - a globally distributed edge computing platform.

```
User → Cloudflare Edge → Worker → KV Storage
```

- **Workers:** JavaScript runtime at 200+ locations worldwide
- **KV Storage:** Eventually-consistent key-value store, AES-256 encrypted
- **ULIDs:** Lexicographically sortable identifiers for posts and delete keys
- **Zero dependencies:** Self-contained, no external services

### Why Cloudflare Workers?

From Cloudflare's documentation:

> Workers KV supports exceptionally high read volumes with low-latency, making it possible to build highly dynamic APIs and websites which respond as quickly as a cached static file would.

Perfect for a pastebin! Popular content gets cached globally, while the free tier offers:
- 100,000 reads per day
- 1,000 writes per day
- Sub-100ms cold start times
- 128MB memory per request

## Security Model

GetPost prioritizes **simplicity over complexity** in its security approach:

**What's Protected:**
- 🔐 **Access control** - 80 bits of entropy in ULIDs (stronger than most passwords)
- 🔒 **Data at rest** - AES-256 encryption by Cloudflare
- 🌐 **Data in transit** - TLS encryption for all requests
- 🚫 **No tracking** - No cookies, analytics, or third-party scripts

**What's Not Protected:**
- Content is theoretically accessible to Cloudflare employees, [with some difficulty](https://developers.cloudflare.com/kv/reference/data-security/)
- No client-side encryption (by design, for simplicity)
- Your computer.

**Privacy Philosophy:**
We choose transparent simplicity over false security promises. For most use cases, ULID-based access control and Cloudflare's infrastructure security are sufficient.

## Development

### Hacking

It's free and easy to get started with your own GetPost instance, either on a domain you already own, or a free "*.workers.dev" subdomain.

Because I love you, I have included a set of credentials allowing anyone to deploy to "https://staging.getpost.workers.dev" - as well as a set of end-to-end tests, and lots of source code comments. Also spared interested parties from painful toolchain misadventures!

GetPost doesn't require the use of Cloudflare's Wrangler tool, the Node Package Manager, or a Rust buildchain. It does require `curl`, `python3`, and a Linux-like environment (termux or WSL should work).

### Build Process

To keep the main worker.js file manageable, a simple well-documented Python script - `autoinsert.py` - loads files from the `deps` folder into `worker.js` to make `worker.packed.js`.

The `deploy.sh` script calls autoinsert.py to assemble the packed worker, loads credentials from a file in the local directory, and uploads the `worker.packed.js` file to Cloudflare.

You can get started by cloning this repository, making a small edit to `worker.js` or one of the resources in `deps` - and running `./deploy.sh staging`.

This loads the credentials from the `.staging` file, assembles your changes, and uploads the file.

Your script will then start running on "https://staging.getpost.workers.dev" - and you can verify it works as expected by running `./test.sh staging`

This loads other values from the `.staging` file, makes a series of requests to the staging URL, and prints "ALL TESTS PASSED" if the responses to the inputs are all as expected.

Be excellent to one another, and follow the instructions in SETUP.md to create your own account with your own credentials, if you intend to do any real work - after all, other folks may also avail themselves of the staging deploy API key!

### Project Structure
```
getpost/
├── worker.js          # Main Cloudflare Worker code
├── autoinsert.py      # Build script (embeds deps/ into worker)
├── deploy.sh          # Deployment automation
├── test.sh            # End-to-end testing
├── SETUP.md           # Detailed deployment guide
├── deps/              # Static assets
│   ├── getpost.css    # Styling
│   ├── getpost.html   # Content template
│   ├── upload.html    # Upload page
│   └── marked.min.js  # Markdown parser
└── .staging           # Shared staging credentials
```

### Testing
```bash
# Test against staging (using shared credentials)
./test.sh staging

# Test your own deployment
./test.sh mydomain

# Generate new baseline hashes after changes
./generate_test_hashes.sh staging
```

### Customization Ideas
- **Custom CSS themes** - Edit `deps/getpost.css`
- **File type support** - Extend `generateHtmlBasedOnType()`
- **Rate limiting** - Add IP-based restrictions
- **Analytics** - Track usage stats (respect privacy!)
- **Content filtering** - Add moderation hooks

## API Reference

### Upload
```bash
POST /post
Content-Type: application/octet-stream
X-TTL: 3600  # Optional: expiry in seconds

# Response includes share link and delete key
```

### Retrieve
```bash
GET /post?key=ULID          # Rendered HTML view
GET /post?key=ULID&raw      # Original file
GET /post?key=ULID&cors=1   # With CORS headers
```

### Delete
```bash
GET /post?key=ULID&del=DELETE_KEY
```

### Debug
```bash
GET /headers    # Request headers and metadata
GET /echo       # Echo request body
```

### Inspiration
GetPost revives the spirit of personal file servers from the pre-GitHub era, when sharing a file meant SCPing it to your homepage. We've made that experience:
- Globally distributed (via Cloudflare's edge network)
- Zero maintenance (no servers to patch)
- Free forever (generous cloud free tiers)
- Instantly deployable (minutes, not hours)

## Advanced Topics

### ULID Format
Posts use [ULIDs](https://github.com/ulid/spec) instead of UUIDs:
- **Lexicographically sortable** (chronological ordering)
- **26 characters** vs UUID's 36 (shorter URLs)
- **Crockford base32** (avoids visual ambiguity: 0/O, 1/I/L)

### Content Type Detection
GetPost examines file headers to determine MIME types:
- **Magic bytes** for binary formats (PNG, PDF, etc.)
- **UTF-8 validation** for text content
- **Markdown rendering** for text files
- **Raw passthrough** for unknown types

### Performance Characteristics
- **Cold start:** ~50ms (Cloudflare Workers)
- **Warm requests:** ~10ms globally
- **KV read latency:** ~10ms from cache, ~100ms from origin
- **Global propagation:** ~60 seconds for KV writes
